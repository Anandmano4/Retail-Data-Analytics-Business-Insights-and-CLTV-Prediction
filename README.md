Build and interpret the CLTV prediction model.


Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization


Steps Involved

1. Data Loading and Cleaning

Imported the dataset and handled missing values.

Corrected data types (e.g., date columns).

Removed canceled transactions and negative values.



2. Feature Engineering

Created features like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value.

Prepared the data for CLTV modeling.



3. Model Building

Used the BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma model for CLTV prediction.

Evaluated the predicted lifetime value of customers.



4. Result Interpretation

Identified high-value customer segments.

Provided insights for retention and upselling strategies.
